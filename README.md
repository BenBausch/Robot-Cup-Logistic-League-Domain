# Robot-Cup-Logistic-League-Domain
This Domain consists of multiple instances of the Robot Cup Logistic League multi-agent Problem.

In each folder you will find Domain and Problem files. These files serve as input to a planner, which should find an optimal solution for each problem. The higher the number of the folder, the more difficult the problem will become.

I also added a script, to automaticly generate the pddl files for you, if you need more complicated Problem instances.
The schript takes parameters as input, such as the number of agents in the world ,etc. 

If you have any questions regarding the script, send me an email.
